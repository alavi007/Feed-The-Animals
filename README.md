# Feed The Animals Game (Unity 3D)

## Description

The objective is to feed the animals by launching food projectiles. 

## Brief Summary

- 3 Animals (Fox, Doe, Deer) spawn from above the screen. There is also a dog that spawns from the side of the screen. 
- Animals have different speeds and lives. 
- As an animal is fed, the player gets a score depending on the amount of projectile the animals were fed with.
- The player's movement is limited within a boundary of both (x, z) parameters and starts with 3 lives.
- If any of the animals cross the screen without being fed, one of the player's lives is deducted.
- If all 3 lives are lost, the game is over.
- Score and Lives are displayed in "Console"
